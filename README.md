Project requirements, cross out or add as needed

Diagrams TODO:
* use-case
* domain model (class diagram)
* assumptions, limitations, interpretations at the beginning or after intro note.
* interaction diagram of most complex scenario
* state chart for any object
* activity diagram for system
* Test cases (?)

1. To develop a system that will hold information about the data needed and their services.

    ~~1.1. To be able to calculate the drag factors based on the current environmental conditions.~~

    ~~1.2. To be able to calculate the acceleration of gravity based on the current altitude.~~

    ~~1.3. To be able to input the other variables, such as skid distance, drag factor, acceleration of gravity, radius of the yaw marks, horizontal and vertical distances, the takeoff angle and potential other data.~~

    ~~1.4. To be able to interact with the Administrator who will validate these values.~~

    1.5. To generate a report about the traffic accident reconstruction justifying the results.

    ~~1.6. To inform the customers about other related news on safe driving.~~

2. To provide a simulation of traffic accident reconstruction (either by animation or simply by mentioning the speed at various times).
    
    ~~2.1. If a authorized personnel wants to see a previous saved traffic accident reconstruction, then the software system should provide this service for free.~~

~~3. The system must be able of future expansion to incorporate information about more velocity estimation and how to expand them in the future.~~
