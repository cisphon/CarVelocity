1. Open up the test cases in the "testing/testCases" folder.
    The text files inside here are what need to be inputed for a test.

2. Open up a terminal.

3. Change directory into just the "testing" folder that contains the jar file.

4. Assuming an up-to-date version of java is installed.
    Run the program with the command `java -jar VelocityClient.jar`

5. You will then be prompted. Use the test cases inside of the "testing" folder.

6. For example, the following would create a new user named "a" with a
    password of "a", and select the skid case and input the required data. 
    Then, it would output the calculated velocity and a report of the data.
